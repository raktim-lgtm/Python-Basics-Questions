        "\n",
        "Answer: Mutability refers to the ability of an object to change its state or content after it has been created. In Python, some data types are mutable (like lists, dictionaries, and sets), meaning their elements can be added, removed, or modified. Others are immutable (like strings, tuples, numbers, and booleans), meaning their value cannot be changed after creation. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the desired changes."

        "\n",
        "Answer: The key difference between lists and tuples lies in their mutability. Lists are designed to be dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or modified after creation. This makes them suitable for situations where the data needs to change over time. Tuples, on the other hand, are designed to be static collections. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. This immutability provides benefits like being usable as keys in dictionaries (which require immutable keys) and offering a degree of data integrity by preventing accidental modification. The choice between using a list or a tuple depends on whether you need a collection that can be modified or one that should remain constant."

This is often necessary when you need to perform operations that require specific data types, or when you want to change how data is represented.

You can have multiple `elif` statements after a single `if` statement.
